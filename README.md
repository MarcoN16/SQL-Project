# SQL

I used pgAdmin4 to manage PostgreSQL for a research project focused on people employed by the company during the 1980s and 1990s. All the employee data from that period is stored in six CSV files.

For this project, I have designed tables to store the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and worked on answering questions about the data. The project includes tasks related to data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
